GitHub doesn’t
natively allow
downloading
individual folders
from a repository,
which can be
inconvenient when
you only need a few
files from a large
project.

This tool simplifies
the process by
allowing you to
download all files
within a specific
directory in a
single click, after
providing your
GitHub token.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Paste the
   GitHub directory
   URL**  
   Visit the tool
   and pass the
   GitHub directory
   link as a `url`
   parameter,
   like:  
   [**download-directory.github.io**`?url=https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/build`](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/build)

2. **Optional:
   Specify a
   filename**  
   Customize the
   downloaded file
   name using the
   `filename`
   parameter:  
   [**download-directory.github.io**`?url=https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/build&filename=three-js-build`](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/build&filename=three-js-build)  
   This saves the
   file as
   **three-js-build.zip**.

3. **Automatic
   Download**  
   Once the link is
   provided, the
   download starts
   automatically.
